          <p>Sebastian may have been li'l, but his impact on this town, and the Parks Department, 
          was anything but li'l. He was an animal, a legend, a friend. He was our beacon of light. 
          He was Pawnee's horse. In what is surely the most monumental news to come out of Pawnee 
          since the eradication of smallpox in 1993, it is with sorrow that we report Li'l Sebastian 
          is dead. But he will never leave our hearts and our memories. 
          His legacy will live on. He sired over 200 mini-horse children, ensuring that future 
          generations of Pawneeans, Americans and citizens of the world will continue laughing and 
          sharing the joy of the Sebastian line. And who can forget when he received his honorary 
          degree from Notre Dame University? That's Dr. Li'l Sebastian to you!</p>
          <p>Li'l Sebastian, we miss you. But we know you are in heaven, looking down on us, doing your 
          two favorite things: eating carrots and urinating freely.</p>
          <p>So gallop on, Li'l Sebastian, in that big horsey ring in the sky.</p>
